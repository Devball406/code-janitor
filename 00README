What is the Code Janitor?
-------------------------

The Code Janitor is a utility for finding "objectionable" content in
source code trees before releasing them to the public.  These can be
things your developers wrote (like profanity, insults, confessions,
and so on), or things that indicate code that might be inappropriate
to use in the project (like copyright notices or license statements).

Getting Started
---------------

This is a web-based application, using Django as its framework.  You
will need Django 1.0 or later.  Django is provided in most recent
Linux distributions, or you can get it from
http://www.djangoproject.com/.

Once you have Django working, you can start using it with the
following commands:

  make
  python manage.py runserver

Then, point a Web browser to http://localhost:8000/.

How to Use
----------

The project searches directory trees for files containing certain
keywords.  In order to use it, you must first give the app a list of
keywords to search for.  Click the "Home" tab (if you're not there
already), and then the link to the admin interface.  Log in using the
user you created above, and then add or remove keywords as needed.

Once you have a set of keywords entered, use the "Scan" tab to enter a
path to scan.  The application will scan the path, and eventually
direct you to a page of results, including file paths and line
numbers.

All past scans can be called back from the "Results" tab.
