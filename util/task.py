# task.py - task management
# Copyright 2010 Linux Foundation.
# Jeff Licquia <licquia@linuxfoundation.org>

# This task manager was originally created for the Dependency Checker
# and Code Janitor projects of the Linux Foundation.  It's fairly
# simple to use; just create a function containing the task you need
# done asynchronously, create a TaskManager object, and call its
# start() function, passing in the task function you created.  Since
# only one task at a time can be run, it's a good idea to check if
# one's already running with is_running().  Any problems (including
# trying to start a task if one's already running) cause the manager
# to throw a TaskError, so you can catch those if you need.

# Once a task is running, you can ask the manager to give you some
# simple HTML to report the task's status with read_status().  It will
# return a None object if no task is running, or a single HTML string
# suitable for embedding into a <div>.  This is designed to be
# embedded into a simple status URL that can be called with
# XMLHttpRequest and dynamically updated with JavaScript in some other
# page.

# As for reporting status, your task function can write
# specially-formatted lines to stdout or stderr.  These take the
# form:
#   TYPE: Data
# It currently supports four types: JOBDESC, MESSAGE, COUNT, and
# ITEM.  JOBDESC is a short description of the job.  COUNT and ITEM
# work together; the job is assumed to consist of COUNT items, each of
# which is reported as it is done with an ITEM line.  MESSAGE is for
# reporting the job's status when it's a little more complicated than
# "x of y items".  A MESSAGE overrides the reporting of COUNT/ITEM
# until another ITEM is received, at which point the MESSAGE is
# suppressed.

# Your task's reporting of these statuses makes its way to the
# manager's read_status() function, and is used to generate the HTML
# that function returns.
